Slogan-PIONEERING THE REBAR REVOLUTIO

-INTRODUCTION OF GFRPREBARS-
WHAT ARE GFRP REBARS?.
GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) is a composite rebar used as a durable, corrosion-resistant alternative to metal rebars for concrete reinforcement. Made of glass fibers in a resin matrix with a spiral wound belt, GFRP was first used in 1975 in the Soviet Union and gained major use in Europe in the 1980s and Japan in the 1990s. Japan introduced GFRP design guidelines in 1996. With proven durability, it is widely used in the USA, Canada, Japan, Europe, and Australia, recognized for its technological and economic benefits in construction.

High Tensile Strength:GFRP rebars have high tensile strength, though with lower stiffness, which may require unique design considerations.
Deformability and Crack Control: GFRP offers elastic deformability similar to metal rebar ductility, with crack control primarily for aesthetics and watertightness, not corrosion prevention.
Design Adjustments: Lower compressive strength and E-modulus require specific design strategies, especially for columns.
Cost-Effective Alternative: MRG GFRP rebars are priced below traditional metal rebar, making them a viable option despite initial higher purchase costs.
Fire Resistance Limitation: Fire protection is needed for GFRP due to lower fire resistance, often requiring concrete cover or cladding.
Global Adoption: GFRP rebar use is expanding globally, with applications in the USA, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Germany, due to advantages over traditional metal reinforcement despite specific design considerations.

Technical Details of MRG GFRP Rebars
1. Tensile Strength:
   - MRG GFRP Rebars possess superior tensile strength, being at least twice as strong as conventional steel of the same diameter. This allows them to withstand significant pulling forces, enhancing structural strength and load capacity. The combination of high tensile strength, corrosion resistance, lightweight nature, and design versatility makes MRG GFRP Rebars an attractive option in construction.

2. Modulus of Elasticity:
   - The modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) of MRG GFRP Rebars is approximately 55 GPa, compared to 160 GPa for steel. While this lower modulus may seem disadvantageous, it can be beneficial in applications like floors and highways, allowing for greater flex under load. This property helps distribute stresses evenly, reducing cracking risk and enhancing overall performance.

3. Shear Strength:
   - The shear strength of MRG GFRP Rebars is significantly affected by the orientation of reinforcing fibers within the polymer matrix. This orientation impacts the rebar's ability to resist shear forces in structural applications.

4. Corrosion Resistance:
   MRG GFRP Rebars resist corrosion in harsh environments, reducing maintenance costs and preserving structural integrity over time. Their lightweight nature also minimizes the overall dead load on structures.

5. PH Alkaline Resistance: 
   These rebars are resistant to various chemicals, including alkalis, making them suitable for corrosive environments. They excel in harsh conditions like marine structures and roadways with de-icing salts.

6. Long-Term Integrity:
   Their resistance to chemical degradation ensures lasting structural integrity, reducing the need for repairs and enhancing the sustainability of construction projects.

7. Creep Rupture
Creep rupture occurs when GFRP rebar fails under prolonged high stress. Key points include:
Creep Coefficient:   Studies show that GFRP rebar with a tensile strength of 900 MPa can guarantee a service life of 100 years if sustained loads are below 50% of its maximum tensile capacity.
Long-term Performance:   Tests conducted under 20% and 40% sustained tensile stress for up to 1670 hours have been performed, showing promising results.

8. Deflection
GFRP bars have higher tensile strength but lower stiffness, leading to increased deflections compared to steel-reinforced units.

9. Bond Behavior
Bond strength is vital for performance:
Bond Strength: Ribbed GFRP bars show a bond energy of 89.4 Nmm and an average bond strength of 11.5 MPa.
Concrete Factors: Concrete strength and cover thickness have minimal effects on GFRP bond strength.

10. Crack Width  
Crack width calculations for GFRP-reinforced sections follow similar methods to steel, with a bond-dependent factor (kb) included.

11. Thermal Conductivity
GFRP rebar has low thermal conductivity, reducing risks of thermal expansion and minimizing cracking.

12. Thermal Expansion
GFRP's thermal expansion coefficient is lower than that of steel, helping to prevent concrete cracking.

13. Elongation 
GFRP rebar has less elongation than steel, which can be advantageous in applications where minimizing deformation is essential.

14. Fire Resistance 
MRG GFRP Rebar is fire-resistant and does not burn directly. With appropriate concrete cover thickness, it can achieve significant fire endurance. For specific fire resistance details, consult a manufacturer or structural engineer.


Machining with MRG GFRP Rebars.
Cutting
Cutting MRG GFRP Rebars is straightforward and can be performed using the same methods as steel rebar, such as:
-Tools: Grinder, band saw, hacksaw, or diamond cutting disks.
-Note: A clean cut is achievable with these tools, but glass fibers may fray if not cut with appropriate tools.

Bending 
MRG GFRP Rebars are linearly elastic and cannot be bent permanently on-site. They will return to their original shape when the bending force is removed. However, prefabricated bent rebar and stirrups are available, customized to meet specific requirements.

Binding 
MRG GFRP Rebars can be tied together using methods similar to traditional steel rebar:
Binding Materials: Traditional binding wires, plastic clips, or knitting wire can be used, along with plastic fix clips.

Step7-Cutting Mechanism.
The MRG GFRP Rebars manufacturing and production process is known as the pultrusion or extrusion process.

Unlike metal, GFRP Rebars do not have a distinct yield point, and rupture occurs suddenly
without significant deformation. The ultimate tensile strength is between 800-1200 Mpa.
The failure strain typically falls between 1.5-2.5%, while the modulus of elasticity ranges
from 40-60 Gpa.
Factors influencing the stress-strain curve include fiber volume fraction, fiber orientation,
matrix material properties, manufacturing process, and environmental conditions. Standards
such as ASTM D7205/D7205M and ACI 440R provide guidelines for tensile testing and design.
